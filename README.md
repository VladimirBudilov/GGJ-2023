# Global Game Jam 2023

I participated in the Global Game Jam 2023 and created a small 2D arcade game within a challenging 48-hour timeframe. In this project, I handled all aspects of coding, and I used the DALLÂ·E-2 AI generator to create all the game's art assets.

**Game Description:**
- Game Genre: 2D Arcade
- Objective: Avoid rocks and collect water as you navigate through the game.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the game!
